For Tuesday March 1st.

My reflections for today are as followed.  We started the day with a scrum to go over the things learned from the previous day.  We had an excercise to complete that included making a batch file to find the ip address of the computer.  Since I have a macbook, I was unable to complete this assignment.  We also learned html and css and some basic fundamentals with common atrributes and html tags.
