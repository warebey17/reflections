Reflections for 3/7 2016

Today on March 7th 2016 I continued to work on my game from last week.  I had some issues and wasn't able to complet the assignment.  I also needed to redo my payroll function assignment since I wrote code over it last Friday and was unable to find any copy of it anywhere.  Today we learned how to do inheritance in Java and how to create an instance.  We learned the difference from Parent class versus child class and why it was necessery.  THere are two assignments we were to work on today.  The first assignment was called fizzbuzz which I completed and uploaded to github.  We were to find the first 101 integers (0 - 100) with loops and once that was done, replace the numbers divisible by 3 to fizz, 5 to buzz and those divisible by "3 and 5 combined" to fizzbuzz.  The 2nd assignment was to create aRobot class with some attributes and then create some child classes with member variablesthat are appropriate to the assignment then upload.  I am currently still working on this assignment.
